SECTION: PLAIN RICE-COOKER ARBORIO RICE

STEP 1. Put arborio rice into a strainer and rinse it until the water runs clear. Pour 2 cups (392 g) of arborio rice into a fine-mesh strainer and hold it under the tap. Run cold water over the rice until the water that drains doesn't look cloudy anymore.
Rinsing the rice will prevent it from clumping up as it cooks.

STEP 2. Place the rinsed rice into your rice cooker and pour in 3 cups (710 ml) of water. If you'd like to use a different amount of rice, keep the ratio at 1 part rice to 1.5 parts of water. For example, if you want to cook just 1 cup (196 g) of arborio rice, use 1 ⁄2 cups (350 ml) of water.Variation: To make risotto in your rice cooker, replace the water with chicken broth or stock. Once the machine has finished cooking the rice, stir 1 cup (100 g) of grated parmesan cheese into it.

STEP 3. Close the lid and turn the rice cooker on. Depending on the type of rice cooker you have, you may need to select "Cook," "Rice," or just turn the machine on. Most rice cookers will turn themselves off once the rice has finished cooking or they'll switch to a setting that keeps the rice warm until you turn it off.
It will probably take around 30 minutes for your machine to cook the arborio rice.

STEP 4. Fluff the arborio rice and let it sit for 10 minutes before you serve it. Once the machine turns off or switches to the "Keep warm" setting, open the lid and use a wooden spoon to gently loosen and break up the rice. Then, put the lid back down and leave the rice for 10 minutes so it can finish cooking.
You can store leftover arborio rice in an airtight container for up to 6 days.

STEP 6. Simmer 3 cups (710 ml) of chicken broth over medium-low heat. Pour the broth or stock into a large pot on the stove and turn the burner to medium-low. Leave the lid off of the pot so you can see when the broth begins to bubble very gently.
You can continue preparing the risotto while the broth heats.

STEP 7. Sauté 1 onion over medium-low heat for 5 to 8 minutes. Heat 2 tablespoons (30 ml) of olive oil in a wide 5 to 6 US qt (4.7 to 5.7 L) pot over medium-low heat. Stir in 1 finely chopped onion and stir it every few minutes as it cooks. Sauté the onion until it softens and becomes clear.Tip: For a more complex flavor, you can add 2 minced garlic cloves with the onions.

Ensure that you don't overcook the onion or it will make the risotto taste bitter.

STEP 8. Add the rice to the onion and cook it for 2 to 3 minutes. Stir 2 cups (392 g) of arborio rice into the pan with the sautéed onion and toast it over medium-low heat until the rice is coated with the oil.
The rice should become fragrant as you toast it. It will also turn clear around the edges but still appear white in the center.

STEP 9. Pour the wine in the pan and let it cook off for 1 minute. Slowly add ⁄2 cup (120 ml) of dry white wine to the rice and turn the burner up to medium. The wine should start bubbling and evaporating as it cooks off.
Stir the mixture constantly as the wine evaporates. This will prevent the onion from sticking to the pan.
You can use a dry white wine, such as Sauvignon Blanc or Pinot Grigio.

STEP 10. Stir in the broth 1 ladleful at a time. Get out a ladle that holds between ⁄4 and 1 cup (180 and 240 ml) of liquid and use it to scoop up some of the hot chicken broth. Pour a ladleful of the broth into the rice while you stir constantly.
The rice will gradually absorb the broth and become tender as it cooks.

STEP 11. Continue to stir in the broth and cook the rice for 18 to 22 minutes. Once the rice has absorbed the first ladleful of broth, stir in another ladleful. Keep adding broth and stirring as the rice absorbs the liquid. It should become creamy and thick.
To test if the arborio rice is done, taste a spoonful. The rice should be tender and not crunchy in the center.

STEP 12. Turn off the burner and stir in the butter, parmesan, salt, and pepper. Stir in 2 tablespoons (28 g) of cubed butter along with 2 cups (200 g) of finely grated parmesan cheese. Taste the risotto and add salt and pepper according to your taste. Then, serve the risotto while it's still warm.
If the risotto is too thick for your liking, stir in extra chicken broth to loosen it.
Refrigerate leftover risotto in an airtight container for up to 5 days.

SECTION: OVEN-BAKED ARBORIO RICE PUDDING

STEP 14. Preheat the oven to 325 °F (163 °C) and butter a baking dish. Take butter and rub it along the inside of a 2 US qt (1.9 L) baking dish. This will make it easier to scoop out the pudding once it's finished cooking.

STEP 15. Put the rice, sugar, salt, and optional vanilla bean into the dish. You can pour 1/2 cup (98 g) of arborio rice, 1/2 cup (100 g) of sugar, and 1/4 teaspoon of (1.3 g) of salt directly into the greased baking dish. If you'd like to give the pudding a richer flavor, add a vanilla bean.Savory Risotto Variation: Mix 1 1/2 cups (294 g) of arborio rice with 4 cups (950 ml) of chicken stock in a Dutch oven. Cover the pot and bake it at 350 °F (177 °C) for 45 minutes. Then, remove the pot and stir in 1 cup (240 ml) more cup of chicken stock and ⁄2 cup (120 ml) of white wine. You can also stir in 1 cup (100 g) of grated parmesan just before you serve it.

To release more of the vanilla flavor, slice it in half lengthwise and carefully scrape out the paste with a knife. Add the bean and the paste to the dish.

STEP 16. Pour in 4 cups (950 ml) of whole milk and scatter the butter over the top. As you pour the milk into the dish, it will mix with the rice, sugar, and salt. You can also stir the mixture gently if you want to ensure that it's combined. Then, drop 2 tablespoons (18 g) of cubed butter over the mixture.
The butter will melt as the pudding bakes and give the rice an even creamier flavor.

STEP 17. Bake the pudding for 1 hour and 45 minutes and stir it frequently. Place the baking dish in the preheated oven and let the rice pudding bake until it absorbs about half of the milk. To help it cook evenly, stir the rice every 10 to 15 minutes.
The top of the pudding will become brown as it cooks. You can stir the top layer that forms back into the pudding.

STEP 18. Remove the pudding and let it sit for 10 to 15 minutes. You'll still see milk in the dish when the pudding is finished baking, but you can take it out of the oven once the rice is soft. Set the dish on the stove and let it cool for 10 to 15 minutes. The rice will continue to cook and absorb more of the milk.
Avoid cooking the rice until all of the milk is absorbed or it will dry out and become chewy.

STEP 19. Serve the arborio rice pudding with a sprinkle of cinnamon. You can serve the pudding while it's warm, let it cool to room temperature, or chill it until it's cold. Then, sprinkle the top of the pudding with a little ground cinnamon. For an even richer pudding, spoon whipped cream on top.
You can refrigerate leftover arborio rice pudding in an airtight container for up to 3 days.
